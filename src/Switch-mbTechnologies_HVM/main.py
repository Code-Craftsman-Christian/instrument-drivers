                    <p><strong>Usage:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Enter colon-separated configurations, e.g "A1: A2: B3: D4".</li>
                    <li>Alternatively a relay can be specified by a 5 digit number 'biioo', where b=board (always 1), 
                    ii=input and oo=output, e.g. "10101, 10102: 10203: 10404".</li>
                    <li>A "Switch settling time in ms" will be waited for after a new configuration is applied.</li>
                    <li>Open means the relay is open/disconnected. No current will flow through. Closed means the relay 
                    is closed/connected, and current will flow through.</li>
                    <li>In the user manual page 8 you can find how channel list and channel configuration are defined 
                    for this instrument. The input channels are indicated with an alphabet (A-D) and the output channel 
                    is defined by a number 1-12. However, for compatibility reasons, the instrument also accepts numeric
                     channel string: 1iioo, where ii is the input channel number and oo is the output channel number.
                    This driver uses the second style.</li>
                    <li>When discharge mode is activate, the given discharge time will be waited for while discharge
                    is activate. Afterwards the instrument is switched back to normal mode. This happens during the 
                    'configure' phase of the driver, i.e. when a new branch is started to be processed.</li>
                    <li>Using a "0" all channels will remain open. This command is not part of the communication
                    protocol but was implemented in the SweepMe! driver for reasons of convenience.</li>
                    <li>TCPIP/LAN communication is possible by registering a raw socket with port 10001.</li>
                    <li>In case of using the resistance box mode, the digital output pin 1 is set to High and a
                     resistance of 300 kOhm is used. After the processing the branch, the digital output pin 1 is
                      set to Low leading to a resistace of 0 Ohm (short)</li>
