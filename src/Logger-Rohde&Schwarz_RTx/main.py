                    <h3>Rohde & Schwarz Oscilloscope Meas Slots</h3>
                    <p>This driver reads out the measurement 'places' of Rohde & Schwarz RT Oscilloscopes. Measurement
                    places are measurements such as as Maximum peak height, periodicity, rise time, and much more. The
                    measurement places can be definied on the device or via SweepMe! for given mode and source
                    (e.g. Channel 1-4).
                    <p>The driver has been tested with RTB2004, but should also work with other RT-Series devices.</p>
                    </p>
                    <p>Setup:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Enable remote control at device.</li>
                    <li>If use preset, the defined measurement places from the devices are used. Note that currently
                    SweepMe! is unable to display the used measurement mode and units in preset mode.</li>
                    <li>Waveform count: Number of waveforms used to average. Set to 1 to retrieve current values.</li>
